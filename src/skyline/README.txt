RULES OF THE GAME / HOW TO PLAY

You are the pilot of an alien UFO that has come to Earth sometime in the future. You have the power to shoot lasers or turn invisible, but not both at the same time.
Your objective is to allow as few survivors to escape the scene as possible, while surviving the longest yourself in the face of an increasing barrage of missiles.

CONTROLS
Use WASD or the arrow keys to pilot your vessel.
Press the space key to toggle between invisibility and opacity.
Direct the mouse to control your laser gun. Click to fire.

SETTING
The scene is set in front of several office buildings. It is between 3 and 4 o'clock p.m., and people are beginning to head home.
 * Each intact window displays how many people are inside of it. If there are no people inside a window, it will turn black.
 * Once those in a specific window realize that aliens are attacking, it will turn pink and its occupants will attempt to exit as quickly as possible.
 * Civilians inside the buildings can move between adjacent windows, but if there is too much movement, the doorways will become clogged and passage will slow.

YOUR POWERS

Laser Gun:
 * Your laser gun is your offensive weapon. Use it to shatter entire windows, or simply to pick off individual people running along the ground.
 * Your laser gun will work against anti-UFO missiles.
 * NOTE: The gun functions in 3-D, so the beam must HIT a target to destroy it. Simply passing over a target will have no effect.

Invisibility:
 * Invisibility is your defensive power. While you are invisible, you cannot fire your laser gun.
 * The humans will walk more slowly while you are invisible, as they do not realize you are there.
 * No new anti-UFO missiles will be fired at you while you are invisible, but you can still be hit by missiles already fired.
